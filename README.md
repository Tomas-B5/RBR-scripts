RBR AHK scripts

You need Autohotkey https://www.autohotkey.com/ installed to run these scripts.

# RBR_Retire_and_random.ahk
If you double press the button (11 on my thrustmaster ts-pc base, probably same on similar thrustmaster bases) this script will retire and pick a random stage. Assuming you were doing hot laps.

# RBR_Restart.ahk
Will restart your stage if it possible if you double click key 12(pretty fast).

# ahk_gear_grind
Needs sound 1 and 2 from C:\ahk_gear_grind\
Yeah this shouldn't be hardcoded probably but I suck with AHK and didn't put much effort into this.
You will most likely need to figure out what buttons of what controller your are using.

In my case the shifter is my 2nd HID device hence. 2Joy1 .. 2Joy8 and the pedals are 3Joy device.

You can figure out what is where using https://www.autohotkey.com/docs_1.0/scripts/JoystickTest.htm
